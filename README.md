### Hello! My name is Anton Konev

I develop apps & launch online-services. I help companies build fast and user-friendly interfaces and reach their goals.

I prefer to make projects from scratch: to build architecture, to prototype, to collect metrics and work fast. Interested in challenging projects in ML.

At present, Iâ€™m an Engineering Team Lead at [recraft.ai](https://recraft.ai).

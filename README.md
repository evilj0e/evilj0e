I’m Anton Konev, engineering leader based in London, UK.

I have 10+ years of experience building scalable products and leading cross-functional teams, and I’m a UK Global Talent visa holder (endorsed in 2023).

I currently lead an engineering team at [Recraft](https://recraft.ai), a modern image editing platform with 3M+ active users in 195 countries and 350M+ image generations. I built a scalable UI, helped streamline planning, and was named a Top Contributor for two consecutive years.

Before that, I was a Tech Lead at [Arrival](https://arrival.com), where I helped scale from 1 product to 8 and built a Digital Assets Storage system that reduced data transfer by 70%, cut deployments from 12 to 5 minutes, and saved 23% in cloud costs. I was also named Employee of the Year twice.

Earlier, at [Yandex](https://yandex.com) I led development of a core platform used by 6,000+ developers and helped reduce time-to-market by 50%.
